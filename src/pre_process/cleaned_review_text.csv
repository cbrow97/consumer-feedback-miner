I was bummed at first sight.The place looked like the 90's called and wanted everything in the place back like stuck in 35 years ago kind of feel and look. The attempts to promote are a nice effort but seems so over blown ""Win a Million Dollars!"" But the risk is maybe ruin your health or get sick or just plain waste your money on substandard food? So our ""meal"" was not good from start to finish. The staff needs some real training. The training videos don't seem to be translating into real life results. The thing that struck me was how can you be happy if the place is always kinda empty and the staff keeps getting cut and makes no money? Take that million from the contest and apply it to the staff and getting the place really revived to today's dining needs. The Salad bar is a throwback feel but an area that could be modernized and improved to be actually healthy but I am not sure that this is that certain something special that the diner of today will respond to so strongly that it will resonate as ""Special."" This is where I am at a loss regard Ruby's, ""What is special about the place that really move the meter?"" Ribs are back! But I do not smell wood smoke when I walk in so you kinda lose me here because I know in a chain what I am going to get, possibly ok ribs but not the type of ""oh wow Ribs"" that you might get at that wood smoker Rib-house down the street. The parking lot sets the tone, the front entry and btw ""What is that smell in the entry way?"" Fix that asap or..well you know.  That whole first impressions thing...wow that was just wrong. That did not say delicious food ahead. What we discovered was we were wrong for not heeding this lil warning. No attention at the front and waitresses looked at us but did nothing. Great why make us wait that long when the place was so empty on a Friday night prime dinner time. The service was not great but it was not the servers fault (We tipped strong because we feel her pain) but then the wait time for an empty restaurant seemed a bit long but not end of the world long. The food however was a massive disappointment.  I am in the wrong here too because I feel like if I am spending near $60 for a quick bite it should at least be pleasant and satisfying. This was neither of those. What I did wrong to was tried to reduce the stress of an already  uncomfortable experience by telling the ""Manager?"" that everything was OK when it was not. I felt like I was being robbed that I had to pay for food that was not as good as an average person would expect quality wise, or flavor wise, for these prices. My error there I will own that one, the other one was selecting this place because it had less of a crowd which meant hey faster service and I am hungry, lets go! But not so much.  One thing I would suggest to BurgerPalace as a chain research the seating and comfort needs of today and change, change is good. The seating is uncomfortable and I get that may be a wise choice if you are trying to speed up table turnover, this place needs to do anything it can to be remotely appealing. Our meal was so bland and forgettable I question where the wheels went off the tracks but they need to rethink, well, everything. Seasonings would be a plus. I am at a loss how this store is open. If I owned it I would close it and start over. This needs so much it will take big money time and a team of sincerely commited experts to focus on the entire concept of community involvement, promotion, building, planning, execution, hiring, training, and everything required to get a winning recipe. They need to call Robert Irvine from the Food TV Network to revamp everything or something. The place needs something more than just a signature salad to win as a restaurant. If the kitchen is not producing food of a high enough quality as prices are out of control people will not step up and open our wallets for mediocrity.  The next time I set foot in one the BurgerPalace they will need to have made some big changes. Nothing personal more of a ""To my standards"" Issue. Prove me wrong you guys I want to see you do well I am rooting for you, but you have a mountain of challenge to overcome. I will be watching to see you make me eat my words by doing all the right things, however I will be watching from afar.

at first sight.the place looked like the 90's called and wanted everything in the place back like stuck in 35 years ago kind of feel and look. the attempts to promote are a nice effort but seems so over blown ""win a million dollars!"" but the risk is maybe ruin your health or get sick or just plain waste your money on substandard food? so our ""meal"" was not good from start to finish. the staff needs some real training. the training videos don't seem to be translating into real life results. the thing that struck me was how can you be happy if the place is always kinda empty and the staff keeps getting cut and makes no money? take that million from the contest and apply it to the staff and getting the place really revived to today's dining needs. the salad bar is a throwback feel but an area that could be modernized and improved to be actually healthy but i am not sure that this is that certain something special that the diner of today will respond to so strongly that it will resonate as ""special."" this is where i am at a loss regard ruby's, ""what is special about the place that really move the meter?"" ribs are back! but i do not smell wood smoke when i walk in so you kinda lose me here because i know in a chain what i am going to get, possibly ok ribs but not the type of ""oh wow ribs"" that you might get at that wood smoker rib-house down the street. the parking lot sets the tone, the front entry and btw ""what is that smell in the entry way?"" fix that asap or..well you know.  that whole first impressions thing...wow that was just wrong. that did not say delicious food ahead. what we discovered was we were wrong for not heeding this lil warning. no attention at the front and waitresses looked at us but did nothing. great why make us wait that long when the place was so empty on a friday night prime dinner time. the service was not great but it was not the servers fault (we tipped strong because we feel her pain) but then the wait time for an empty restaurant seemed a bit long but not end of the world long. the food however was a massive disappointment.  i am in the wrong here too because i feel like if i am spending near $60 for a quick bite it should at least be pleasant and satisfying. this was neither of those. what i did wrong to was tried to reduce the stress of an already  uncomfortable experience by telling the ""manager?"" that everything was ok when it was not. i felt like i was being robbed that i had to pay for food that was not as good as an average person would expect quality wise, or flavor wise, for these prices. my error there i will own that one, the other one was selecting this place because it had less of a crowd which meant hey faster service and i am hungry, lets go! but not so much.  one thing i would suggest to burgerpalace as a chain research the seating and comfort needs of today and change, change is good. the seating is uncomfortable and i get that may be a wise choice if you are trying to speed up table turnover, this place needs to do anything it can to be remotely appealing. our meal was so bland and forgettable i question where the wheels went off the tracks but they need to rethink, well, everything. seasonings would be a plus. i am at a loss how this store is open. if i owned it i would close it and start over. this needs so much it will take big money time and a team of sincerely commited experts to focus on the entire concept of community involvement, promotion, building, planning, execution, hiring, training, and everything required to get a winning recipe. they need to call robert irvine from the food tv network to revamp everything or something. the place needs something more than just a signature salad to win as a restaurant. if the kitchen is not producing food of a high enough quality as prices are out of control people will not step up and open our wallets for mediocrity.  the next time i set foot in one the burgerpalace they will need to have made some big changes. nothing personal more of a ""to my standards"" issue. prove me wrong you guys i want to see you do well i am rooting for you, but you have a mountain of challenge to overcome. i will be watching to see you make me eat my words by doing all the right things, however i will be watching from afar. fwiw","[('looked', 'like'), ('salad', 'bar'), ('parking',

Big mistake. It was coffee, I guess, but litereally tasteless. Then I ordered chicken tenders and CRISPY fries. If I order fries, I specifically order them well done because they are normally underdone no matter where you go and browning them negates some of the greasiness. Obviously, the waitress (yes, I use gender specific labels...sue me. I was a waitress for years and never took offense at being referred to as such) misunderstood my request and brought out a plate of rock-hard chicken tender-looking things with dried out, stringy white meat inside and a pile of underdone, whitish, mealy fries. Even the GMO corn syrup-laden pseudo-ketchup didn't help. The waitress was polite enough, but obviously over worked as she was serving at tables and behind the bar, then apparently forgot I was there and I had to stand up and leave the table to get her attention.

15,sLCLgiWDMgKC25LHCLqlSg,2020-02-05,2,,"This actually used to be one of our favorite places to go for a good and inexpensive meal. The salad bar alone drew us back again and again for a fresh and healthy meal.This place has gone totally downhill. Repeatedly our favorite the garden bar has been poorly stocked, not fresh, missing items, and a complete untidy mess.Tonight we stopped in for a couple of burgers. The restaurant was uncrowded, but we sat there for over half an hour after putting in our order until our meals finally arrived, and when they did the fries were cold. Our waitress did get us a new plate of fries (and they were excellent, hot and fresh).

She then walks us to a dirty table (mind you there were tons of clean tables) that has one chair.  She says ""hold on while I get you a chair, oh and I'll have to wipe the table.""   We asked if we could just have one of the clean tables.  She seemed surprised but she did let of have a booth.  Mind you my girlfriend has to walk with a cane after a knee operation.  We finally get seated and the waitress passes us by about 7 times before coming to our table and asking if we were ready to order.  We were not offered drinks.  We order our food and drinks at the same time.  The waitress then says she will get our drinks right away.  She walks off.  About 10 minutes later, still no drinks.  So I walk over to where she is.  She is sitting at the table counting her tips.  I agin request our drinks.  She finally brings them over and starts talking about how they are short staffed. (Isn't everyone these days?)   I am not sure how that applies to her forgetting our drinks.  So now she goes on and talks about how she is a school teacher that lost her job during the pandemic but has worked at the restaurant for a while.   She goes on about all of the lazy kids they are hiring.  She then said her daughter works there but isn't one of the lazy ones. We finally get our food.

While we were eating, and elderly couple near us requested that the blinds be closed because the sun was shining right in.  They close the blinds.  The waitress (same as ours) comes back and starts telling the lady that they had to argue with a customer sitting near the window who wanted to look out.  Why on Earth would you come back and tell the lady that?  Handle that stuff in-house.  Now the lady feels bad. So after about 30 minutes, we finally get refills and the check dropped off.  No offer for dessert just the check in the table. It takes her about 15 -20 minutes to bring the cash out machine over.

they were not busy at all surprisingly.  when we asked if we could have a table for two the person seating us said ""yeah"".  she then walks us to a dirty table (mind you there were tons of clean tables) that has one chair.  she says ""hold on while i get you a chair, oh and i'll have to wipe the table.""   we asked if we could just have one of the clean tables.  she seemed surprised but she did let of have a booth.  mind you my girlfriend has to walk with a cane after a knee operation.  we finally get seated and the waitress passes us by about 7 times before coming to our table and asking if we were ready to order.  we were not offered drinks.  we order our food and drinks at the same time.  the waitress then says she will get our drinks right away.  she walks off.  about 10 minutes later, still no drinks.  so i walk over to where she is.  she is sitting at the table counting her tips.  i agin request our drinks.  she finally brings them over and starts talking about how they are short staffed. (isn't everyone these days?)   i am not sure how that applies to her forgetting our drinks.  so now she goes on and talks about how she is a school teacher that lost her job during the pandemic but has worked at the restaurant for a while.   she goes on about all of the lazy kids they are hiring.  she then said her daughter works there but isn't one of the lazy ones. we finally get our food.  the food was actually very good and it is the only reason i didn't give one star.  while we were eating, and elderly couple near us requested that the blinds be closed because the sun was shining right in.  they close the blinds.  the waitress (same as ours) comes back and starts telling the lady that they had to argue with a customer sitting near the window who wanted to look out.  why on earth would you come back and tell the lady that?  handle that stuff in-house.  now the lady feels bad. so after about 30 minutes, we finally get refills and the check dropped off.  no offer for dessert just the check in the table. it takes her about 15 -20 minutes to bring the cash out machine over.  she only did so because i held my card out in front of her as she was walking by.  she had spent that 15-20 minutes gabbing away at a table.  as for the interior of the restaurant.  the salad bar (which we did not have) looked old and not very fresh.  the wooden blinds on the windows are broken in several places.","[('salad', 'bar'), ('10', 'minutes'), ('30', 'minutes'), ('minutes', 'later'), ('20', 'minutes'), ('one', 'star'), ('5', 'minutes'), ('short', 'staffed'), ('come', 'back')]",[],[]

37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,2021-08-14,1,,"We usually go to Chillis across the street but decided to try here since it had been a while. Big mistake. We were seated right away, not very busy for a Friday night. Guess that should of clued us in. Started with the bone in buffalo wings app. They were good, but $12.99 for 8 pieces was a little steep. My wife ordered the Asiago bacon chicken. The menu described it as TWO chicken breasts, and she received one small piece of chicken, so no leftovers and it was $18.99! I ordered the 12 oz. Ribeye steak for $22.99 and told the waitress medium. I know she heard me because she read our entire order back to us to confirm..My steak arrived and was well done. Not a trace of pink. The quality of the cut was not too good and I doubt it was a 12 oz. I have had better prime ribs for less. I waited to tell the waitress but she never returned to check on us. So I ate it as cooked. One son had NEW fish and chips. We all agreed the 3 small strips he received looked more like fish sticks or chicken tenders. For $13.99 it was a disappointment. My other sons choice was the smokehouse burger for $12.99. This was the best value for the money, except he had onion rings instead of fries, and received 5 rings so if youre hungry opt for fries. I waitress was polite but never returned to ask how everything was. Later she dropped off the check without asking if we wanted desert.

Was staying at a hotel across the street, and I was tired but hungry, so decided to have a quick dinner there.For 15 minutes, I sat there unable to get the waiters to come take my order.  Eye contact attempts and my raised hand were  deliberately avoided and/or ignored.  I did actually caught attention of one of the waiters but he decided it was time to turn around and go busy himself with something else other than attending my needs which I was ready to pay for and tip.

90,V17rzZ1fvjBbNhS0rZ0fVw,2021-06-26,1,,"Took my father for a nice Father's day lunch on 6/20/21.  We waited for at least 15 minutes before our server even came to get our drink order; at which time he said ""guess they snuck you in on me"".  There was only 1 other table, (1 person) in the server's area when we were seated and finally placed our order yet we waited over an hour to receive it.  That was only after I asked our server about it.  I know that covid has caused a lot of business' to be short handed so we waited patiently.  Server said he got busy all at once and our order was being prepared.  The other three tables that came in considerably after we placed our order were finishing their meals and leaving.  There was not doubt in my mind that he forgot to turn our order in.  Once we received our order, my father's Asiago Steak & shrimp came with no shrimp and the steak was small and hurriedly cooked.

at burgerpalace restaurants over the  years, but today's experience was really, really poor that i felt compelled to write my first restaurant review. my husband and i decided to use our burgerpalace gift card.  the restaurant was not busy when we arrived a little past noon.  we were seated right away, but it took awhile for the waiter assigned to our booth to take our drink order (water and iced tea).  then it took even longer to get the drinks.regarding our food, my husband's meal was fine.  however, the cole slaw and honey mustard was missing from my chicken tenders meal, which was to be included.  the waiter realized i was missing the items and said he would get them for me, but he never returned.  i waited and waited, but  finally ended up having to go to the salad bar to get the honey mustard dressing.  i also had to get my own set of silverware from the table behind me, as i didn't have any, and had to get the ketchup and extra napkins from the cleaning station located near our booth.the waiter never returned to our table to see if everything was okay or if we needed refills on our drinks.  i finally had to go to the hostess to ask for another glass of water and iced tea.  last, but not least, i found a hair on my plate that was not visible until the end of my meal (the french fries had covered it).the waiter never returned to give us our bill so we had to track down the hostess to see if she could take our payment for the meal.  our waiter finally appeared and decided to take care of our payment at that point.  you guessed correctly, we did not leave a tip due to the poor service we received.needless to say it will be awhile before we go back to that particular burgerpalace.  :-(","[('salad', 'bar'), ('chicken', 'tenders'), ('drink', 'order'), ('go',

I immediately got a text on my phone that the food would be ready in 20 minutes. 20 minutes later I arrived at the restaurant and had to call to announce my arrival.

She came back out and said I hadn't and I then showed her my internet receipt. She said ""Oh, Postmate"". She went back inside and returned with my burger.

on my phone that the food would be ready in 20 minutes. 20 minutes later i arrived at the restaurant and had to call to announce my arrival. i was told that someone would come out to the car(coronavirus). a young lady came out to the car with a bill. i told her i had already paid and she went back in to check. she came back out and said i hadn't and i then showed her my internet receipt. she said ""oh, postmate"". she went back inside and returned with my burger. i tipped her and drove to the other side of the parking lot. i opened the container and opened my cold bacon cheeseburger. i immediately drove back to the restaurant and called. the young lady came back out and i requested hot food. she went back inside and returned in a couple minutes with the same food.  she told me that the manager said that i would have to deal with postmate with any problems. i said i just wanted hot food, not a refund. she said that was the manager's answer. i left with the cold food and called the manager the next day when i wasn't too angry to speak civilly and was told that when you order through a third party the third party is responsible. i emailed burgerpalace corporate and have not heard back. postmate also is not returning emails and does not list a phone number.  i do not understand how a restaurant can refuse to take responsibility for the quality of the food they serve. very unhappy. will never return.","[('parking', 'lot'), ('minutes', 'later'), ('20', 'minutes'), ('came', 'back')]",[],[]

never be repeated.  enter...approx. 5 pm...quiet only a few customers.  we experienced the cluster of ""shift change which should be transparent...but we were introduced to 3 ppl, then ended up with our original server...megan, who couldn't have been more apologetic.so we are thinking salad bar...but when we view it...most everything was nearly empty...when we asked about it...no one seemed too interested in restoking.  i think no one could decide whose job it was...the regional manager is too busy on his phone to guide and direct.   it was dinner time remember.   so we ordered cocktails...good prices...the regular margarita was good...but don't order a second...it was an entirely different tasting and sweet....same bartender.? sent it back...the second was better but not like the first.  $6.00.so the salad bar gets replenished... that's our choice...no soup!now my friend starts eating and bites into a metal carton staple...ypu know like the kind from a box of produce...sharp and open pronged...an inch or more long with sharp edges ( it was in her salad bowl....we didnt put it there!!! ) so we call megan, she is appalled ( my friend did not swollow it thank god)...so she - megan - says..."" we are lucky...the regional manager is there today...she will go get him""....""he"" could have cared less, on the phone, made us wait, cannot remember an apology...said he needed to get a report from my friend...left and never returned.. .megan had my friends salad comped...and we couldnt get out of there fast enough.the place needs a good cleaning, managers who care as much as the staff, attention to details/tlc..and far better customer service.  judging from the regionals lack of concern and safety for his customers and the appearance and the lack of cleanliness of his restaurant...i assure you ""we""... and our local friends will not be back...and we have...and will continue to tell our friends..( ellenton-fl )","[('salad', 'bar'),

139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,2020-03-04,3,,"Ok the menu has changed a little since I have been there. And there is more variety then before. I have been in several time and they have a little something different past there normal menu most  of the time. I suppose it is a out frequency. During the day it seems too dark in there for me. During the evening the lighting is good. The decor needs an update in my opinion. Otherwise the place is very normal and plain looking. Food... my wife and I had the chicken fajitas. My chicken had some burn spots on it that I couldn't chew through. It was just a little bit but that sticks in your mind, you know. It tasted good and the vegetables were cooked well. We also got the salid bar. Their salad bar is great. I think it is probably the best in town. Service.. our server was quiet. And she did not come around much. Not that we really needed anything. She visited our table four times and one of those was to give us the check. Last but not least, price....

thought we would make this stop an early dinner before going to a show and seeing all of the cool tourist traps in the area. first things first. yes, the waitress was new and i believe her inattentiveness was because she was new, so, i'll give her a break on that. also, i saw most of the draft beers were out because cups covered the taps and since i spend a lot of time in bars, i know that that means. we were there at about 2 or 3 in the afternoon, so the restaurant had been open for a while before we arrived. we ordered the salad bar and the steak and rib combo. after i got the salad, i ordered a beer from one of the uncovered taps. well, after about 30 minutes of waiting for the beer, the waitress finally realized that she hadn't got it for me yet. well, the tap blew and it was empty. a woman, not the manager, but talked like one came to the table. offered me a bottle of the beer and would ""adjust"" my tab to the new price. then she said that the ribs were not done and would not be done for about another hour.  i told her i didn't want the bottle beer and i didn't want meal any longer.   she did us a ""favor"" by only charging us for the salads and soda (the only items we actually got in the hour we spent waiting.we walked to another restaurant in the area and had a great meal. my only advice if you want to eat at this place is to ask 8fntheir issues have been resolved and if they actually have the food you want. other than that, not much else you can do. definitely a two star restaurant. i cannot recommend this place, especially if you have time constraints.","[('salad', 'bar'), ('30', 'minutes')]",[],[]

Well tonight (Valentine's Day) we were looking forward to their food. I called to place an order at 4:45pm, which seemed a safe bet as it wasn't the busiest part of the dinner hour. I was put on hold for over 6 minutes. I finally hung up (assuming I'd been forgotten) and called again.

If so, you should head on down to BurgerPalace in Elyria!Stopped in here with my mom recently. The parking lot had more potholes than there are holes in your average slice of Swiss cheese. A sign we missed of the horrors awaiting us inside...Walking in, the front waiting area smelled strongly of ribs and barbecue sauce...to the point where it was nauseating. (How is that even possible?!) Once seated, I noticed the table next to us needed cleaning underneath. Looked like the patrons used Parmesan cheese as confetti. The smashed particles look...gross. The atmosphere is interesting. I'm not sure what direction they were going for. It was like the 80s, 90s, and 00s threw up in there--and not the more stylish parts. I totally forgot they made plastic table cloths with felt on the underside. Haven't seen one of those babies since 2003! Adding to the ambiance were unruly children and grown men loudly blowing their nose. (This happens anywhere.)The food was lackluster at best. My soup spoon was sticky on the underside, and I noticed after eating it that the crackers I was given were recycled from another patron...the wrapper had dried soup on them that was NOT mine. My mom ordered a steak dinner. The steak was puny and dry...and the baked potato tasted dirty and old. She did enjoy the salad bar. I didn't take advantage of it; it was too close to the entrance and therefore not appetizing to me.My mom also stated that there were no locks on the bathroom doors. She also witnessed an employee not washing their hands after using the restroom next to her. We didn't stay for dessert, and I didn't order a cocktail I had been eyeing. Based on our experience (as well as plenty of Facebook reviews stating the drinks totally sucked), we weren't missing out on anything there.After visiting this BurgerPalace, it was immediately clear to me why so many of them in the Northeast Ohio area shuttered...and it's mind boggling to me how this one is still operating! I have never wanted to un-eat a meal so badly in my life. It was truly a God-given miracle that we didn't wind up with food poisoning! Not worth the money, avoid at all costs.

wish they gave you a z-pack with your check after the meal? if so, you should head on down to burgerpalace in elyria!stopped in here with my mom recently. the parking lot had more potholes than there are holes in your average slice of swiss cheese. a sign we missed of the horrors awaiting us inside...walking in, the front waiting area smelled strongly of ribs and barbecue sauce...to the point where it was nauseating. (how is that even possible?!) once seated, i noticed the table next to us needed cleaning underneath. looked like the patrons used parmesan cheese as confetti. the smashed particles look...gross. the atmosphere is interesting. i'm not sure what direction they were going for. it was like the 80s, 90s, and 00s threw up in there--and not the more stylish parts. i totally forgot they made plastic table cloths with felt on the underside. haven't seen one of those babies since 2003! adding to the ambiance were unruly children and grown men loudly blowing their nose. (this happens anywhere.)the food was lackluster at best. my soup spoon was sticky on the underside, and i noticed after eating it that the crackers i was given were recycled from another patron...the wrapper had dried soup on them that was not mine. my mom ordered a steak dinner. the steak was puny and dry...and the baked potato tasted dirty and old. she did enjoy the salad bar. i didn't take advantage of it; it was too close to the entrance and therefore not appetizing to me.my mom also stated that there were no locks on the bathroom doors. she also witnessed an employee not washing their hands after using the restroom next to her. we didn't stay for dessert, and i didn't order a cocktail i had been eyeing. based on our experience (as well as plenty of facebook reviews stating the drinks totally sucked), we weren't missing out on anything there.after visiting this burgerpalace, it was immediately clear to me why so many of them in the northeast ohio area shuttered...and it's mind boggling to me how this one is still operating! i have never wanted to un-eat a meal so badly in my life. it was truly a god-given miracle that we didn't wind up with food poisoning! not worth the money, avoid at all costs. go to the nearby wendy's or steak & shake. you'll get way better quality food for a fraction of the cost.","[('looked', 'like'), ('salad', 'bar'), ('parking', 'lot'), ('baked', 'potato')]",[],[]

The place is easily visible from the road.  There is ample parking on site as well.  The outside of the place looks typical for all BurgerPalace locations I have seen.  My visit here was on January 1, 2021.Let's start with Covid-19 protocols.  Like most places, masks are required for entry and while not seated at your table.  Entry is also not permitted if you exhibit any symptoms related to Covid-19 as well.  There is hand sanitizer available as you come in.  Only select tables and booths are available to ensure proper social distancing.We got here around 12:15 pm that day for lunch.  We were immediately greeted and seated when we came in.  We went around the long way to our table to ensure social distancing.  Once seated, Quinn came to the table to introduce herself, give us menus to look over, and asked what we wanted to drink.  It had been a while since I had been to a BurgerPalace, so it took a little while to look through the menu.After looking over the menu and the inserts, my mom and I decided to go with the 2 for $22 deal.  For the starter, we went with the House Baked Soft Pretzels.  For the entrees, we both went with the Classic Cheeseburger.  We also added the Garden Salad bar as well.Once ordered, we were able to go to the Garden Salad Bar.  There are protocols in place here as well.  It is self-service, but gloves and a new plate are required each time you go there (they are provided there for you).  The salad bar is actually pretty big with lots of different options.  It turned out to be a really good beginning to lunch.  A little bit after eating the salad items, the soft pretzels came out.  The queso was a great dip to go along with it as well.After about 10 minutes, the burgers came out to the table.  The burgers were hot and the fries were as well.  The burgers were cooked to order and juicy too.  It was a really good meal overall for both of us.  We were definitely full by the time we left.Overall, this was a very good visit here.

is in the town center area of the city.  the place is easily visible from the road.  there is ample parking on site as well.  the outside of the place looks typical for all burgerpalace locations i have seen.  my visit here was on january 1, 2021.let's start with covid-19 protocols.  like most places, masks are required for entry and while not seated at your table.  entry is also not permitted if you exhibit any symptoms related to covid-19 as well.  there is hand sanitizer available as you come in.  only select tables and booths are available to ensure proper social distancing.we got here around 12:15 pm that day for lunch.  we were immediately greeted and seated when we came in.  we went around the long way to our table to ensure social distancing.  once seated, quinn came to the table to introduce herself, give us menus to look over, and asked what we wanted to drink.  it had been a while since i had been to a burgerpalace, so it took a little while to look through the menu.after looking over the menu and the inserts, my mom and i decided to go with the 2 for $22 deal.  for the starter, we went with the house baked soft pretzels.  for the entrees, we both went with the classic cheeseburger.  we also added the garden salad bar as well.once ordered, we were able to go to the garden salad bar.  there are protocols in place here as well.  it is self-service, but gloves and a new plate are required each time you go there (they are provided there for you).  the salad bar is actually pretty big with lots of different options.  it turned out to be a really good beginning to lunch.  a little bit after eating the salad items, the soft pretzels came out.  the queso was a great dip to go along with it as well.after about 10 minutes, the burgers came out to the table.  the burgers were hot and the fries were as well.  the burgers were cooked to order and juicy too.  it was a really good meal overall for both of us.  we were definitely full by the time we left.overall, this was a very good visit here.  service was on point and the food was great.  i will definitely be coming back here in the future.  they also have an e-mail rewards program.  if you're in the town center area of the city, this place is still worth checking out for a meal.","[('salad', 'bar'), ('10', 'minutes')]","[('garden', 'salad', 'bar')]",[]

wanted to at least order my mother and i a steak since we couldn't do what we really want due to the covid 19 outbreak. now, before people say give them a break because of this, just know the similar restaurants in the same area are just known to be less than a pleasurable experience. i ordered online and my mother actually was picking it up to bring on the way to see me so that we may eat together. she called from up there to tell em the curb side was a no go because after 20 minutes of waiting no one came out so she went in. the manager was the one who dealt with my mother in saying that the order wasn't ready and didn't know when it would be. she also said the ticket number didn't matter because they were so overwhelmed and ""everyone ordered steak"". not a good look. my mother handed her the phone because i called to see if everything was ok. the manager basically told me the same thing. if i hadn't paid ahead, of course i would have cancelled. i had my mother leave because i didn't want her having to do all that on mother's day. my husband went back up there and brought the order back almost two hours after it was supposed to be done. ( i gave them an hour because of covid and it being mothers day). the steak was thrown together. there was no difference in the well and medium well done steaks and both were missing the salad. we did however get the baked potato but that was a no go because they decided to put bacon bits on it when that's not how we ordered it because guess what... you guessed it. i don't eat pork . this was ridiculous. i hope any other companies who decide to open back up during the pandemic is ready. this manager told me that they are open , but not fully staffed. they aren't fully open not ready to serve inside, curb side and to go like they say. plus they had a line out of the door trying to figure out what happened to their online order and curbside orders. they may as well have opened their dining room up to full capacity because the way this was set up, there was literally no room for social distancing if that was their goal. do better camp creek burgerpalace !!!","[('well', 'done'), ('20', 'minutes'), ('baked', 'potato')]",[],[]

284,UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2022-06-19,2,,We had had some issues before trying to order the emailed specials for the day using the app. Essentially they won't let you order what they emailed you ...you have to call it in. Ok. I call it in and I made the dinners the same just to be easier. The special was 10.99 for 6 oz steak dinner and 11.99 for 6 oz ribeye. (we are seniors so 6oz is ok).

really think about how i could rate this experience better than 1..   the server was a 4 as she was trying her best.... but if this is how this place is managed...  will never go to another burgerpalace again.went to burgerpalace across the street from our hotel.  tried to go to a mexican restaurant which is normal for us when out of town ---  but it was cinco de mayo so ---- all forget going to a mexican restaurant unless you want to wait for an hour and ...  well...  never mind.the parking lot was nearly empty so thought a good choice.... wrong!!!  only two servers and one bartender.  most of the tables were empty because no one was working.  hostess was sweet, kind, and very nice!!  told us it would be about a 25 minute wait so ...  we did.  once we were seated we decided to share a few mexican appetizers since mexican food is one of our favorites and the salad bar looked less than appealing --- which was the original plan.   ordered two appetizers -- one was the nachos and didn't want the bbq sauce (yes, on chicken nachos) so asked if we could get salsa.  the server was very accommodating...  we also ordered the bean and chicken quesadilla.  food came up in about 20 min which was okay based on the fact that very few people were working.  the food was warm at best ---  the quesadilla was about a 6 and was pretty good --- light on fillings and seemed like a small portion --- but the best food we had!the nachos --- well --- really, really not good!!  the chicken was not cool but seemed to come  out of the refrigerator..  the cheese was lumped like nacho cheese but lumpy and cool...   the salsa --- well, it was the warmest food on the plate but it wasn't salsa -- it was marinara!!!our server came by and i kindly let her know that the kitchen probably accidentally gave us marinara instead of salsa...  and she said ---- ""they said they are out of salsa and this was the closest thing they had..""  what????    a side a marinara with our nachos and they thought we wouldn't notice it wasn't salsa???????????????????$30 later and we should have gone to taco bell for a much better dinner as this was the horrible!!!  tipped our server for doing a great job as we were thankful she came to work.ruby tuesdays --- wow --- never so disappointed.  before covid and the world we used to live would have never put up with this...   thanks for coming to work ---  good luck staying open with this type of food!","[('salad', 'bar'), ('parking', 'lot'), ('pretty', 'good')]",[],[]

I was wondering why it wasn't on Yelp until I tried to add the business and BurgerPalace popped up. The same location as well as phone number, I decided to call the place to find out who they actually were. They then told me they were BurgerPalace but also cooked for the Captain's Boil. My order through GrubHub:I saw nothing but seafood on this page and decided to give them a go through GrubHub. I ordered crab legs for 2 and plus the crawfish. I was feenin for some seafood and thought I would give them a whirl. Baddest and most expensive experience I've ever had in my life!!Crablegs:The crab legs for one comes with 2 clusters and 5 legs on each from what I was told. So ordering for 2, I figured I had 4 clusters plus the corn and potatoes as well as the crawfish also with corn and potatoes. No dice!!I got ripped off bad on the crab legs. I had 2 clusters with the legs and they put in just the two bodies with no legs at all! I was so pissed!! Crawfish:As this is crawfish season, how in the world did I end up with the tiniest crawfish imaginable! There was not one decent size crawfish in my order at all, and I may have gotten only 10, and that's being generous. I probably got less than that. Captain Boils sauce:Are you kidding me?? Really?? This so called sauce was nothing more than messy at best. It didn't bring out anything to me particularly in the seafood at all, well for the little seafood I did have. That was a total waste!!Corn on the cob:That tasted pretty good. Nice sweet corn with somewhat of a little kick is always favorable to me. I did have 3 of those which I think I should have 4-5 because I had 2 orders of the crab legs and 1 crawfish which also comes with it. Again, ANOTHER EPIC FAIL!!Potatoes:That was a total joke as I was supposed to get 3 but they served them quartered up. I may have had 6 pieces of potatoes out of the whole thing!!

this place. i saw this place on grubhub which was listed as the captain's boil. i was wondering why it wasn't on yelp until i tried to add the business and burgerpalace popped up. the same location as well as phone number, i decided to call the place to find out who they actually were. they then told me they were burgerpalace but also cooked for the captain's boil. my order through grubhub:i saw nothing but seafood on this page and decided to give them a go through grubhub. i ordered crab legs for 2 and plus the crawfish. i was feenin for some seafood and thought i would give them a whirl. baddest and most expensive experience i've ever had in my life!!crablegs:the crab legs for one comes with 2 clusters and 5 legs on each from what i was told. so ordering for 2, i figured i had 4 clusters plus the corn and potatoes as well as the crawfish also with corn and potatoes. no dice!!i got ripped off bad on the crab legs. i had 2 clusters with the legs and they put in just the two bodies with no legs at all! i was so pissed!! crawfish:as this is crawfish season, how in the world did i end up with the tiniest crawfish imaginable! there was not one decent size crawfish in my order at all, and i may have gotten only 10, and that's being generous. i probably got less than that. captain boils sauce:are you kidding me?? really?? this so called sauce was nothing more than messy at best. it didn't bring out anything to me particularly in the seafood at all, well for the little seafood i did have. that was a total waste!!corn on the cob:that tasted pretty good. nice sweet corn with somewhat of a little kick is always favorable to me. i did have 3 of those which i think i should have 4-5 because i had 2 orders of the crab legs and 1 crawfish which also comes with it. again, another epic fail!!potatoes:that was a total joke as i was supposed to get 3 but they served them quartered up. i may have had 6 pieces of potatoes out of the whole thing!! price:this whole total epic fail cost me $66.00 including the tip for my grubhub driver. i have never in my life had such disgusting piss poor service from a so-called seafood restaurant!!","[('pretty',

This salmon was a hickory glaze and I got a side of two loaded baked potatoes. I was so apprehensive about the entire thing, but I wanted to take a chance.

platter with ribs, shrimp, and chicken ($22 bucks)...the portions of this plate were...disappointing and definitely not worth 22 dollars. the rest of the food was mediocre. we did tip our waitress because regardless of my feelings towards the cleanliness and food portions, she did bust her tail and was friendly. we will not return.","[('come', 'back'), ('pretty', 'good')]",[],[]

Once the food was ordered we went and help yourself to the salad bar.

My big issue was constantly having to tell the waiter to fill a bar drinks even after bringing stuff to the table and seeing the cups completely empty.

to start, the first worker we encountered ignored us as we walked in, walked past us multiple times without saying a word to us and left us waiting at the door to be seated for about 5 minutes in a mostly empty restaurant. another waitress came over and sat us at our table. the table was sticky and dirty, high chair had food crusted on it and broken snaps and the booth seat was collapsed. against our better judgement, we ordered the salad bar with our food. it was under stocked, not fresh and what was had the tongs/spoons laying in the food, handle and all. they seemed understaffed and our young waitress was juggling multiple tables and greeting guests, it took a little time to get her attention for silverware. about 10 minutes after ordering, we heard the kitchen call order up. the middle aged waitress went to the kitchen, came out looking at us and then just stood there not taking out food to anyone. after quite a bit of time, our food was brought out cold, mushy and absolutely disgusting. the bbq nachos was topped with what looked like american cheese sliced that cooled into a plastic like texture. the chicken was puverized into a sauce that looked like vomit. my husband's philly cheesesteak hoagie was cooked on a dirty griddle, we both spit out our first bite and it was covered in burnt black speckles. the bathrooms were the worst ever encountered in a restaurant. the women's had poop smeared on one of the seats, the other yellow drips down the side.  piss on the floor and toilet paper strewn about - it is clear it had not been cleaned in many business days. customer service, poor. food, disgusting. establishment, a disaster. i've been to many burgerpalace - this is an embarrassment to the brand.","[('looked', 'like'), ('salad', 'bar'), ('10', 'minutes'),

540,LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,2022-05-15,1,,"I reviewed this restaurant about a year ago, and it was two stars.  Several weeks ago, my wife and I decided to try it again.  This time, one star and I doubt we will ever return.First, I would like to say the young lady that was our waitress was as good as any we've had anywhere.  That's your single star, BurgerPalace bad:  YOU NEED A TRAINED MANAGER!  This location had a bunch of young kids hanging around the entrance to greet and seat you.  Too bad they had no instructions as to how to do their job.  One of them was also cleaning tables.  Too bad no one trained him to get all the slop off the tables:  yes, my side of the table was not wiped cleaned.  Opening the napkin wrapped silverware show a fork that was not clean.  We had burgers.  My wife's was as she ordered.  Mine was great, but only as a shoe sole!   Grossly overcooked.Why does this chain think they can operate without a trained manager?

i've been to one other burgerpalace in harrisburg that i wasn't impressed with and this one followed suit. i had the cheddar broccoli soup and the broccoli was half raw. needed cooked longer. i can handle al dente to a point but spare me crunchy vegetables in soup. panera has them beat hands down with their broccoli cheddar  soup, too bad there isn't one nearby. the baked potato was ok but it takes a lot to screw up a baked potato. the salad bar was very basic without much fanfare. the smoked ham cut in little cubes was way too smokey tasting. overall the food deserved two stars but there is no way to break the rating down.the service was five stars, again, no way to break it down.but in the end the place is only deserving of one star because you take your health into your own hands going inside. we're in the middle of a pandemic. covid cases in clearfield county continue to rise and so does the death toll. i realize this is dubois pennsylvania and the politics of the region play into the whole ""i have my rights"" dialog, and people do, but not when they interfere with my rights. why have a sign on the door of the restaurant saying masks are required when you are seating people who come in without wearing masks? you don't even ask them to put one on. add a sentence at the bottom off the sign that says ""note: we do not enforce this mask rule"" so that i can make an informed decision whether or not i want to expose myself to covid from people walking in past my table without wearing a mask. this is not an outdoor restaurant. i left before i could see if the people who were seated without masks went up to the salad bar not wearing them. i don't have to really guess if they did or didn't. so if you feel you're immune from covid and are put off by wearing a mask then here's a place for you altho frankly, even without the pandemic, the food alone wouldn't have me coming back. but most importantly, if you're not going to enforce the rule you state on the entrance door then you need to either take the mask sign down all together or include a statement that you're not enforcing the rule so people like me have the option of turning around and going back to their car. that is not asking much.","[('salad', 'bar'), ('one', 'star'), ('baked', 'potato'), ('going', 'back')]",[],[]

they did not have the alfredo for her pasta. so i was like why bring out half the food and not tell us earlier that her meal was unavailable? so, my sister re-ordered after i had to run her down. i, also, asked for a manager. no manager or re-ordered food ever came. keep in mind that i'm not eating my food until my sister's comes. i finally asked another waiter for the manager, and when he did come, he said that it wasn't that they didn't have alfredo but that the order was put in wrong. so the server lied. he also tried to defend her as if she was so busy but the restaurant was not busy at all!!! instead of owning the mistakes made, even when we told him how she never came back to check on us or refill drinks. so by then my sister is mad and asked for our ticket for just the food we had. she didn't want the re-order, she just wanted to pay and leave because we were not out for free meals like he offered. i, myself, know the steps you take when you screw up on an order, since i had been a server for 8 years. they still sent out the re-ordered in a togo box by the 2nd server and brought me a togo as well since i didn't eat without my sister's food. our server and  the manager never came back to our table to apologize or give us the check, so we left hungry minus the app we shared. i know this restaurant will not miss our money but they will not see it or our serve again!!!! i felt like we were treated with no respect, as if we had did something wrong. we were not rude in any shape or form but were treated as if we were the ones who acted as such!!","[('could',

make a special trip to this wrentham location for dinner, arriving a little before 7:00. they were closed! we had used the iphone maps app, which posts their closing time as 9:00. then i checked google, which also lists their closing time as 9:00. then i checked yelp, which has the closing time as 10:00!!burgerpalace itself has posted on yelp. they know about their listing there!three major sites that people rely upon for hours of operation are all wrong! if only one was wrong, that would be bad enough, but all three are off by several hours! and continue to be!with gas at $5/gallon, we wasted money and time. and our evening plans were ruined.a word to the wise: don't go to this ruby tuesday for dinner. you can't rely upon their posted hours.if a zero-star rating was possible, that's what we would give this burgerpalace experience.  by definition, food doesn't get worse than no food, and service doesn't get worse than no servicehopefully, all the hours of operations will be corrected soon, so others won't have the same aggravating experience. or better yet, burgerpalace could stay open until at least 9:00.",[],[],[]

mother and i made the trip to the restaurant to put the coupon to use.we both got the hamburger meal and we both added the all-you-can-eat salad bar to our meals for a $5.99 upcharge. the salad bar is a meal in itself, always with lots of choices and fresh ingredients. i did notice this visit that the salad bar was missing both croutons and bacon bits, two of my favorite ingredients to a salad, so i was a bit disappointed but there were still plenty of other delicious ingredients to add to my salad so i was still pretty satisfied with the salad bar. on my last two visits i have noticed items missing from the salad bar but i am wondering if the reason may be that because the restaurant closes rather early on sundays (we usually get there around 4 pm and they close down at 6 pm) they might not replenish things that run out on the salad bar around that time of the day. but of course that is just a theory. we both enjoyed our meals and the salad bar as an add-on really hit the spot.i noticed this time they have a new menu and they added some new items and took away others such as the hamburger sliders/salad bar combo which i used to order quite often (i hate to see that option go). a lot of the items featured on the new menu are the same as before but i did see a few changes.anyway, i am glad i got to visit the restaurant this weekend and i really did enjoy my

here today and was extremely disappointed.  here are the following failed grades:1) wait staff not consistently wearing masks.  i had to ask our waitress to pull hers up when she came to our table2) i ordered their 6 oz sirloin medium rare.  it was served cooked well done...actually waaaay overdone.  it was inedible, like a hockey puck.  i did not eat it3) i ordered a baked potato with butter only...it was served with sour cream only. i do not like sour cream on my potato. i did not eat it4) we had to ask for salt 5) the spinach artichoke dip was watery and tasteless.6) my wife's broccoli was very salty.  she did not eat it.i told our waitress about the overdone steak and the potato and she asked what i wanted to do about it.  i told her at least take my plate off the bill, which they did.  then i asked to see the manager and was told he was very busy helping in the kitchen as they were short staffed today.  i think that is the answer to my poor serving.  also, since no one was actively supervising the staff, they felt free to wander around without their masks on.this was the worst experience i have had in a restaurant in years.  it is doubtful that i will eat there again unless all i want is their salad bar, which was very tasty.  therefore, all i had for dinner was a salad and some corn.good luck if you eat here.  be prepared to not get anything like you expected.  i didn't bother asking for a new plate because of the nearly half hour wait to begin with.","[('salad', 'bar'), ('well', 'done'), ('artichoke', 'dip'), ('baked', 'potato'), ('short', 'staffed'),

I observed the salad bar and it was pretty sad. A lot of stuff was pretty low and it didn't look like any of the staff were concerned about it. I ordered the grilled chicken salad and my guest had the 8 oz sirloin. Our waiter was at attentive and overly friendly. However after receiving our food the drink refills went down. I waited over 10 minutes before I got my water refilled. Nothing special about the food.

613,iFt1Fk7Urw9O_z1TOkGeRA,2021-12-05,1,,"I was very disappointed in the Customer Service and Communication here! We called and ordered our food for carryout 30 minutes before we got to the restaurant. When we got there, we walked to the bar area.  The bartender tells us to go around the corner for pickup orders ....we get to the pickup window and no one is there....we wait 5 min and a young lady comes out the kitchen and asks for our order name....then she walks away and never talks to us again.  She and the bartender walks back and forth serving customers while we are just standing there looking at others being served.

Approximately 10 minutes go by until someone comes out and notices us and asks us to wait until she has found a section that was open. She found a small booth right next to a party of 9 people. The booth was still dirty so we had to wait for the worker to clean the booth. There was nobody else in the restaurant but it seemed important that we sit next to the party of 9... We sit down and Jennifer was our server. We had come in an hour before close, but now it felt closer so we try to decide and order fast. My girlfriend orders coconut shrimp and the endless salad bar. Our server comes to take our order and right as my girlfriend orders the salad bar... The employee that we thought had clocked off and filled her box with food came out and started tearing the salad bar down. She was still on the clock, she just didn't care that we were standing there waiting. My girlfriend speaks up a little bit louder and confirms that we could get the salad bar. Jennifer said that's not a problem. I also ordered the salad bar and the ribeye steak with the bourbon chicken mashed potatoes and broccoli.

asks us what we would like to have on the salad bar to be sure we can grab whatever we would like. my girlfriend and i grab two plates and fill the plates with whatever we can have because we know there was not going to be a second trip. everything we eat from the salad bar tasted like it was soaked in ham juice. our food comes. the steak that i ate wasn't the best, but my girlfriend enjoyed my french fries. we tipped jennifer because we know how hard it is to be a server, but particularly a server who is covering for a lack of leadership. i do not think we will be going back there anytime

with my food, i definitely saw him scratch his head and not wash his hands so i'm doubtful that there were any hygiene practices in place. from previous trips, i have not been super impressed with burgerpalace their mozzarella sticks were notably crispy, but otherwise average, though they did come in a generous portion. their spinach artichoke dip was not very flavorful. their soft pretzels sticks were tasty, but the cheese sauce that came with it was congealed and hard to dip into. also nothing special about their breadsticks, though the butter sauce on the side was a nice touch.  if you're looking for food of this type, i'd stick with tgi fridays and applebee's for better quality.","[('artichoke', 'dip')]","[('spinach', 'artichoke', 'dip')]",[]

The steaks we ordered were very thin cut, a little more cooked than we usually get, but I'm sure that's because they were cut so thin. The French fries were cold and stale tasting, we did get a second batch which was better. The restaurant was out of baked potatoes at 6:00 which shouldn't happen, they don't go bad that quickly that you can't keep extra on hand. There was just no leadership in the kitchen, a lot of people complaining about the wait time for the food and then the food.

quesadilla... the other 2 people (1 child and my husband) got no food.  20 min passes and still no food!  we went to the bar and questioned 2x by now and was told the kitchen is slow, we are the only table in the restaurant with no food!  we didn't see our waitress in this 20 min span, i went to the waitress station and got napkins and ketchup, i also went and got a rag from another table that still wasn't bussed or wiped when we had a spill and cleaned the mess up.  no management skills at this location at all!  this should not be acceptable at any business much less a restaurant.  when the remaining food did arrive it was inedible, my husband couldn't even bite through his chicken sandwich because it was so over cooked, the youngest child's pasta and sauce was ice cold and the fries tasted as if they were left from the day before.  items on the salad bar actually had ice on them as if they were frozen.  we could see at least 3-4 people in the kitchen so actually making edible food (burgers, sandwiches, wings and kid pasta) shouldn't be challenging.  and after everything we still got a bill for $100+.  now everyone is hungry and it's only 30 min later because everyone's food was disgusting.  stay away","[('salad', 'bar'), ('chicken', 'sandwich')]",[],[]

There was a sign on the door that the fryer was down so we couldn't order anything fried.  At 1:00 on a Saturday afternoon there was only one other table seated when we arrived.  Should have been my first clue.  We were 2 adults and 2 children.  The children ordered plain hamburgers and one also got the salad bar.  One adult ordered the salad bar and I ordered broccoli cheese soup. We also had 2 Cokes, 1 iced tea and a water.  We waited well over an hour for the hamburgers and  the soup.  The soup was cold and had sat so long it had congealed on the top and shook like jello when I touched it.  The waitress was still at the table and I asked her was it normal for the soup to be like that.  She couldn't even be bothered to answer.  I told her she could take it  back which she did.  She didn't offer me an appology, a fresh bowl or a different menu item.  Just left and never came back.  We never were asked if the rest of the meal was ok or if we needed drink refills.  I wanted to walk out but we waited way, way to long for the check.  I asked here if there was a manager and she said yes and turned around and went back in the kitchen.  When the manager arrived I told her how bad everything had been.  She said the soup was fine that it had just sat under a heat lamp.  That could be true but it must have been there for an hour.

that the fryer was down so we couldn't order anything fried.  at 1:00 on a saturday afternoon there was only one other table seated when we arrived.  should have been my first clue.  we were 2 adults and 2 children.  the children ordered plain hamburgers and one also got the salad bar.  one adult ordered the salad bar and i ordered broccoli cheese soup. we also had 2 cokes, 1 iced tea and a water.  we waited well over an hour for the hamburgers and  the soup.  the soup was cold and had sat so long it had congealed on the top and shook like jello when i touched it.  the waitress was still at the table and i asked her was it normal for the soup to be like that.  she couldn't even be bothered to answer.  i told her she could take it  back which she did.  she didn't offer me an appology, a fresh bowl or a different menu item.  just left and never came back.  we never were asked if the rest of the meal was ok or if we needed drink refills.  i wanted to walk out but we waited way, way to long for the check.  i asked here if there was a manager and she said yes and turned around and went back in the kitchen.  when the manager arrived i told her how bad everything had been.  she said the soup was fine that it had just sat under a heat lamp.  that could be true but it must have been there for an hour.  her idea of compensation was for me to give her my address and she would send me a discount for my next visit.  i told her i  was traveling and just passing through and i would not be coming back.  i asked if there was anything she could do for us today since i didn't even get to eat anything after spending 1-1/2 hours in her fine establishment.  she said nope, sorry nothing she could do.  i wouldn't send my worst enemy there.  i can be very understanding that things happen but these guys didn't even try to care.the other adult in our party used the ladies room and said it was  very dirty and had smeared feces everywhere.  that's all i will say about that.they blame so many problems on covid but they were not busy, only saw 3 takeout orders go past us during our 1-1/2 hrs, and the waitresses and hostess were just sitting in the bar area on their phones.  a guy came out of the back with an apron on and a cigarette in his hand.  he went outside and smoked right outside our window.  i don't know if he was the cook and took a break or what.  after we left i pulled up the reviews for this place and blame myself for even trying it.don't say you haven't been warned.","[('salad', 'bar'), ('bar', 'area'), ('came', 'back'), ('never', 'came')]","[('never', 'came',

Though my meal was good and my daughter enjoyed her pasta, someone seemed to have dropped the ball in the presentation of my husband's meal.

If I had picked up the meals and noticed how my husband's meal was packed, I would have returned it. My husband got the bourbon chicken he ordered, but he also got ""bourbon broccoli!""

restaurants for a quick, decent dinner. though i have previously reviewed this restaurant favorably, i was not happy with our last experience. we ordered dinner on sunday for pick up. i went with my usual (hickory bourbon salmon, rice, grilled zucchini); my husband had the bourbon chicken with broccoli and mac and cheese; my daughter ordered the chicken carbonara. though my meal was good and my daughter enjoyed her pasta, someone seemed to have dropped the ball in the presentation of my husband's meal. usually, the veggies are separated for the to-go meals, especially when there is a sauce involved. who wants their veggies swimming in a sauce intended for the meat??? just hurt looking at how this meal was prepared/packed for pick up. my daughter picked up the order and didn't bother looking before leaving. if i had picked up the meals and noticed how my husband's meal was packed, i would have returned it. my husband got the bourbon chicken he ordered, but he also got ""bourbon broccoli!"" seems someone just didn't care when packing this meal. i know there are plenty of problems in this world and having an abundance of bourbon sauce on one's broccoli may not be a big deal. but, for folks like me who like for the food to not only taste good but look good presentation-wise, i was a bit disappointed in burgerpalace this time. may be a while before i return.
